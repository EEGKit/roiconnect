# ROI connectivity toolbox for EEGLAB

This toolbox allows performing connectivity analysis between regions of interest. Regions of interest are defined based on popular fMRI atlases, and source localization is performed through eLoreta and Beamforming. Connectivity analysis is performed between all pairs of brain regions using Granger Causality, Directed Transfer Entropy, and many other methods. Visualization is performed in 2-D and 3-D.

Code developped by Stefan Haufe and team, with EEGLAB interface, coregistration, 3-D vizualisation and Fieldtrip integration performed by Arnaud Delorme.

# Available features

- ROI connectivity analysis using TRGC and CS
- Use of surface or volumetric atlases
- Compatibile with Fieldtrip, Brainstorm and NFT head models
